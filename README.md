- **AWS Services:** Lambda, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, EKS, Terraform, CloudFront, DynamoDB
- **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **DevOps:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Automation, Jenkins, Ansible, Tomcat, Maven, Sonarqube

## 🛠️ Projects

### Project 1: [CI/CD Pipeline: (DevOps)](link-to-repo)
   Create a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI. The pipeline should automatically build, test, and deploy a sample application to a staging environment, followed by an automated deployment to production upon approval.

  "Spearheaded the implementation of DevOps best practices, leading to a 20% reduction in system downtime,
  improved collaboration between development and operations teams, and faster release cycles."
  "Elevated the success rate of continuous integration pipelines to 95% by implementing automated testing suites, reducing the number of defects in releases."


### Project 2: [CI/CD Pipeline AWS:](link-to-repo)
    Implement a CI/CD pipeline for a Python application using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy. Automate the testing and deployment process for your application.

  "Achieved a 40% reduction in deployment time by optimizing AWS CodePipeline workflows,
  enhancing the efficiency of the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) process."

  "Streamlined build processes on AWS CodeBuild,
  decreasing build times by 50%, thus accelerating development cycles and improving overall project delivery speed."

  "Implemented parallelization in AWS CodeBuild,
  reducing build times by 60% and significantly accelerating the delivery of features in the development pipeline."


  Skills: AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, Python.
   
### Project 3: [Container Orchestration with Kubernetes:](link-to-repo)
   Successfully fine-tuned Kubernetes cluster resource allocation, resulting in a 20% reduction in infrastructure costs while maintaining optimal application performance."

  Reduced Docker image sizes by 40%, enhancing deployment speed and minimizing storage costs without compromising application functionality.
  
  Optimized Kubernetes pod startup times, reducing the time required for application components to become fully operational by 25%.
